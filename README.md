# Fake_News_Detection-Machine_Learnning
In this project, I applied a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to differentiate between real and fake news. I will use Fake and True News data sets, mix them and build a classifier to identify which news is Fake and which one is True. At the end I will perform Manual testing to be able to identify any text imported

### Task:
* Import Libraries
* Read and explore a textual dataset
* Build a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer
* Create a confusion matrix and understand its components
* Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy

### Dataset
